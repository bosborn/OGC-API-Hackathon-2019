== Subject

The subject of this Engineering Report (ER) is a hackathon event that was held from June 20th to 21st, 2019 to advance the development of OGC Application Programming Interface (API) specifications. An API is a standard set of documented and supported functions and procedures that expose the capabilities or data of an operating system, application or service to other applications (adapted from ISO/IEC TR 13066-2:2016). The OGC API Hackathon 2019, as the event was called, was hosted by the Geovation Hub in London, United Kingdom. The event was sponsored by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Ordnance Survey.

== Executive Summary

(( The following is, as all texts in double square brackets, a helper text. Please remove this and all other helper texts once done. ))

(( The Executive Summary clause shall contain the key findings and results in a concise form. A more detailed description of the findings should be in the body of the report. ))

(( The Executive Summary shall contain a business value statement that should describe the value of this Engineering Report to improve interoperability, advance location-based technologies or realize innovations. ))

(( This section shall include precise descriptions of the requirements that have been addressed by the work documented in this Engineering Report; together with the research motivation that answers the fundamental question: What motivated us to address this topic in this report? ))

(( This section provides an overview of recommendations on how to further proceed with the achievements documented in this ER. ))

(( This section shall be between 1-3 pages.))

The output of this hackathon should lead to a solid, common core and advancement of a whole new generation of OGC standards that are flexible in modern IT environments.
